# Education

* (2018-2019) **Master's Degree**, ESEIAAT-UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya), *Master's Degree in Space and Aeronautical Engineering*
* (2008-2017) **Bachelor's Degree**, University of Seville, *Degree in Physics*.
* (2007-2008) **High school**, IES Severo Ochoa, San Juan de Aznalfarache, *Science and technology*.
* (2002-2006) **Secondary school**, IES Severo Ochoa, San Juan de Aznalfarache.

# Experience
* (2019-present) **PhD Candidate**, [CommSensLab](https://prs.upc.edu/) UPC, Barcelona.
My research, as part of the CommSensLab is related with ionospheric scintillation monitoring and modelling.
Using several sources, as GNSS-R NASA Satellite CYGNSS, it can be studied the intensity and occurrence of
ionospheric disturbances as Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs), to in the end, improve the existing ionospheric models.
* (2019-present) **Systems engineer** [NanoSat Lab](https://nanosatlab.upc.edu/en) UPC, Barcelona.
In parallel with my PhD work, I'm involved in the NanoSat Lab team as part of the [RITA](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344402035_RITA_REQUIREMENTS_AND_PRELIMINARY_DESIGN_OF_AN_L-BAND_MICROWAVE_RADIOMETER_OPTICAL_IMAGER_AND_RFI_DETECTION_PAYLOAD_FOR_A_3U_CUBESAT) payload project,
the winner of the GRSS Second Grand Student Challenge organized by IEEE-GRSS, that consist in the design and
manufacture of a Remote Sensing payload for a 3U cubesat integrated by the NSSTC in UAE.
The payload includes an L-Band Microwave Radiometer and a Multispectral camera for Soil moisture, vegetation and NDVI
monitoring. I'm the responsible for the Multispectral camera and optics, and involved in the Mission analysis, CONOPS,
and power/data budget.
* (2019) **Hardware engineer**, [NanoSat Lab](https://nanosatlab.upc.edu/en) UPC, Barcelona.
As part of my Master's Thesis I was working in NanoSat Lab in Barcelona designing the hardware
of an On-board computer for Cubesats. In this period I learnt how to design the schematic, layout of the PCB
and also soldering the components and electrical testing of them.
* (2017-2018) **Home teacher**, (Maths, physics...), Seville. ~100 hours
* (2013-2017) **Analog design and layout of integrated circuits**, [Teledyne Anafocus](https://teledyne-anafocus.com/), Seville.
I was in charge of design of electronic analog blocks for CMOS image sensors manufactured
in the company. I worked for 5 or 6 different proyects working along with teams
of 8-10 people including analog and digital designers.
* (2013) **Analog design of integrated circuits**, [Teledyne Anafocus](https://teledyne-anafocus.com/), Seville.
6-month scholarship
* (2012-2013) **Assistant rowing coach**, *Club Nautico Sevilla*
* (2009-2014) **Home teacher**, (Maths, physics...), Seville, ~140 hours
