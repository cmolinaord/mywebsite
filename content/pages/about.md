Title: About me

Hi!

I'm Carlos Molina and I'm a Physics student from Seville (Spain). I've been
working at Anafocus for 4 years as an Analog Electronic Engineer and Layout Engineer. Anafocus
is a company based in Seville which designs, manufactures, tests and sells custom CMOS Image Sensor
and Vision Systems.

I'm also a passionate about aerospace engineering, astrophysics and space exploration.
In 2017 I was invited by ESA to assist to [ESOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Operations_Centre) as
social media to the event #Sentinel2Go, and we lived the launch of the Vega Rocket
with the Sentinel-2A as a payload from the ESA Operations Centre. That was a life-changing event
for me, now, I want to continue studiying within the field of aerospace engineering or astrophysics.

I'm also a open-source lover. I use [Arch Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchLinux)
as my every-day desktop. I'm a member of [SUGUS](https://sugus.eii.us.es/), the group of
open-source users and developers from the University of Seville. I've done some introductory
courses on Python and NumPy and C languages.

I also write in Wikipedia, basically in spanish contribuiting
in [Rowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing) topics, and in the Wikidata Rowing Wikiproject.

In my free time I like to practice Rowing, which is my sport since I was 9 years old, in which
I have competed every year in Spanish National Championships. In the last year I've also
started to do snowboard, and cunrrently I'm learning to play guitar.
I'm also an amateur photographer, (see my Flickr profile below).
